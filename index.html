<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a freshman at MSU. I am going into the Games and Interactive Media major. A fun fact about me is that I have been to 7 different countries. This is a website to share some of the adventures I want to go on/have in the future. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<h3>Rocket league</h3>
<p>This is my most played game of all time, but honestly, I cannot recommend it in it's current state. As you reach the higher ranks, it is full of AI's now that can dribble perfectly and while beatable, are just unfun to play against. However, some of my best memories are from this game. Playing 3's late at night during COVID with my friends will never be replicated in another game. The combination of a high skill ceiling and lots of chances to score 0-second goals leads to so many awesome moments.</p>

<h3>Titanfall</h3>

<p>I love this game purely because of the movement. I wish Apex was able to recreate it. The way everything can be chained together and momentum can be preserved feels so good to play. Try it out for yourself!</p>

<h3>Dead Cells</h3>
<p>This game is not as well known as the other 2, but is just as good. It is a rogue-lite, meaning you accumulate a little power over time but restart runs often. I like how I can get a run in in between things, but do not have to commit to it for a long time. It also has a very satisfying parry system that allows you to play as fast or as slow as you want.</p>
