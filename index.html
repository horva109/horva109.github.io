<h2>About me<h2>
<p>I am a freshman at MSU. I am going into the Games and Interactive Media major. A fun fact about me is that I have been to 7 different countries. I am a big runner. I plan on running 50 miles in 24 hours over the summer. I am also really into basketball. I can't wait for March Madness!</p>
<h2>I want to tell you a little about some of my favorite games</h2>
