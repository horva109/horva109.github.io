<h2>About me<h2>
<p>I am a freshman at MSU. I am going into the Games and Interactive Media major. A fun fact about me is that I have been to 7 different countries. I am a big runner. I plan on running 50 miles in 24 hours over the summer. I am also really into basketball. I can't wait for March Madness!</p>
<h2>I want to tell you a little about some of my favorite games</h2>
<h3>Rocket league</h3>
<p>This is my most played game of all time, but honestly, I cannot recommend it in it's current state. As you reach the higher ranks, it is full of AI's now that can dribble perfectly and while beatable, are just unfun to play against. However, some of my best memories are from this game. Playing 3's late at night during COVID with my friends will never be replicated in another game. The combination of a high skill ceiling and lots of chances to score 0-second goals leads to so many awesome moments.</p>
