<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a freshman at MSU. I am going into the Games and Interactive Media major. A fun fact about me is that I have been to 7 different countries. This is a website to share some of the adventures I want to go on/have in the future. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>One of the adventures I want to go on is bungee cord jumping off a cliff side. I feel like this is relatively safe, but a great story to tell people. Here are a few different places that offer it!</p>

<p>Another adventure I want to go on is skydiving. This one is definitely the most risky, but the most fun. Not many people have done this, and I think it is a unique experience that more people should have. Here are some places to do it!</p>

<p>My final adventure to share is the Wim Hof Retreat. WIm is someone who specializes in cold therapy and breathing techniques. I think he could help bring me a lot of mental clarity. Here is a link to his website!</p>
